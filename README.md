# hgss-moves
 this balanced branch is done for gegalix's hack, [heart gold balanced](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=403232).  check it out!

### directions:
 put armips (@KingCom on github) and narchive (@nickworonekin on github) either somewhere in your PATH or in the github directory.  might decide to actually include it if necessary
 
 run build.bat
 
 waza_tbl.narc (the output) is the move data narc ready to insert!  happy hacking

### TODO
 label things better (target, the flags field, move effects, check out contest appeal field)
 
 look into move expansion and thus animations as well
