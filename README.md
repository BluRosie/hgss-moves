# hgss-moves
 a small armips repo that builds narc a011 when it's run.  hopefully allows for easy editing

### directions:
 run scripts\make.bat in the root directory
 
 replace narc a011 with a011.narc

### TODO
 label things better (target, the flags field, move effects, check out contest appeal field)
 
 look into move expansion and thus animations as well
